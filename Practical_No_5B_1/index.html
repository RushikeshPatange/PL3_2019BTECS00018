        <h1>How to put machine learning models into production</h1>
        <h2>
            The goal of building a machine learning model is to solve a problem, and a machine learning model can only
            do so when it is in production.

        <h1>From model to production
        </h1>
        <section>
            <p>
                Many teams embark on machine learning projects without a production plan, an approach that often leads
                to serious problems when it’s time to deploy. It is both expensive and time-consuming to create models,
                and you should not invest in an ML project if you have no plan to put it in production, except of course
                when doing pure research. With a plan in hand, you won’t be surprised by any pitfalls that could derail
                your launch.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are three key areas your team needs to consider before embarking on any ML projects are:
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Data storage and retrieval</strong><br />
                <strong>Frameworks and tooling </strong> <br />
                <strong>Feedback and iteration</strong>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>

            <h3>Data storage and retrieval</h3>
            <p>
                Data can be stored in on-premise, in cloud storage, or in a hybrid of the two. It makes sense to store
                your data where the model training will occur and the results will be served: on-premise model training
                and serving will be best suited for on-premise data especially if the data is large, while data stored
                in cloud storage systems like<em> GCS </em>, <em>AWS S3</em> , or <em>Azure</em> storage should be
                matched with cloud ML training and
                serving.
            </p>
            <p>
                The size of your data also matters a lot. If your dataset is large, then you need more computing power
                for preprocessing steps as well as model optimization phases. This means you either have to plan for
                more compute if you’re operating locally, or set up auto-scaling in a cloud environment from the start.
                Remember, either of these can get expensive if you haven’t thought through your data needs, so pre-plan
                to make sure your budget can support the model through both training and production
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if you have your training data stored together with the model to be trained, you still need to
                consider how that data will be retrieved and processed. Here the question of batch vs. real-time data
                retrieval comes to mind, and this has to be considered before designing the ML system. Batch data
                retrieval means that data is retrieved in chunks from a storage system while real-time data retrieval
                means that data is retrieved as soon as it is available
            </p>
            <p>
                Raising and answering questions relating to data storage and retrieval is important and will get you
                thinking about the right way to design your ML project.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Frameworks and tooling </h3>
            <p>
                Your model isn’t going to train, run, and deploy itself. For that, you need frameworks and tooling,
                software and hardware that help you effectively deploy ML models. These can be frameworks like
                Tensorflow, Pytorch, and Scikit-Learn for training models, programming languages like
                <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and<strong>
                    Go</strong>, and even cloud environments like AWS, GCP, and Azure.
                <br />
                After examining and preparing your use of data, the next line of thinking should consider what
                combination of frameworks and tools to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The choice of framework is very important, as it can decide the continuity, maintenance, and use of a
                model.To help determine the best tool for the task, you should research and compare findings for
                different tools that perform the same job. For instance, you can compare these tools based on criteria
                like:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Efficiency:</strong> How efficient is the framework or tool in production? A framework or tool
                is efficient if it optimally uses resources like memory, CPU, or time. It is important to consider the
                efficiency of Frameworks or tools you intend to use because they have a direct effect on project
                performance, reliability, and stability.
                <br />
                <strong>Popularity</strong>: How popular is the tool in the developer community? Popularity often means
                it works well, is actively in use, and has a lot of support. It is also worth mentioning that there may
                be newer tools that are less popular but more efficient than popular ones, especially for closed-source,
                proprietary tools. You’ll need to weigh that when picking a proprietary tool to use. Generally, in open
                source projects, you’d lean to popular and more mature tools for reasons I’ll discuss below.
                <br />
                <strong>Support</strong>: How is support for the framework or tool? Does it have a vibrant community
                behind it if it is open-sourced, or does it have good support for closed-source tools?How fast can you
                find tips, tricks, tutorials, and other use cases in actual projects?
            </p>
            <p>
                One more question you need to answer is how many platforms/targets does your choice of framework
                support? That is, does your choice of framework support popular platforms like the web or mobile
                environments? Does it run on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS? Is it easy to customize or implement in this
                target environment? These questions are important as there can be many tools available to research and
                experiment on a project, but few tools that adequately support your model while in production.
            </p>

            <h3>Feedback and iteration </h3>
            <p>
                ML projects are never static. This is part of engineering and design that must be considered from the
                start.
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting feedback from a model in production is very important. Actively tracking and monitoring model
                state can warn you in cases of model performance depreciation/decay, bias creep, or even data skew and
                drift. This will ensure that such problems are quickly addressed before the end-user notices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider how to experiment on, retrain, and deploy new models in production without bringing that model
                down or otherwise interrupting its operation. A new model should be properly tested before it is used to
                replace the old one. This idea of continuous testing and deploying new models without interrupting the
                existing model processes is called continuous integration.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many other issues when getting a model into production, and this article is not law, but I’m
                confident that most of the questions you’ll ask falls under one of the categories stated above.
            </p>
            <p>
                As such, design systems come with clear documentation for developers
                on many of these topics under their
                <em>Getting Started for Engineers</em> section. This helps onboard
                first-time developers. There are several other engineering issues that
                design systems can help solve—JavaScript polyfills, support for Vue or
                React frameworks, distributing library assets using a CDN, SCSS
                post-processing or overrides, built-in accessibility, and so on. The
                point is that the design system goes far beyond the visual guidelines.
                Supporting engineering tasks is a part of what a design system does.

                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
                Effectively putting an ML model in production does not have to be hard if all the boxes are ticked
                before embarking on a project. This is very important in an ML project you’ll embark on and should be
                prioritized!
            </p>
            <p>
                While this post is not exhaustive, I hope it has provided you with a guide and intuition on how to
                approach an ML project to put it in production.
